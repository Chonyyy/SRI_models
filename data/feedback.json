{"note on the hypersonic similarity law for an unyawed\ncone .\n  it is now known that the hypersonic similarity law derived for\nslender cones and ogival bodies under the assumption, is\napplicable for mach numbers as low as 3 .  this note makes use of\na series development to infer the hypersonic similarity law for\nunyawed cones from the taylor-maccoll differential equations and\nassociated boundary conditions .  a simple approximate formula\nfor the function of the similarity law is obtained,\nand the drag function computed with this formula is compared\nwith kopal's numerical results and, for very slender cones, with\nvon karman's linearized formula .": "similarity", "lift of slender delta wings according to newtonian\ntheory .\n  an approximate system of equations is derived to\ndescribe the inviscid flow past a flat slender\nwing at angle of attack, in the limit and .\nthe aspect ratio is required to\napproach zero at the same rate as the mach angle in\nthe flow behind the shock wave .  only a\nsingle parameter appears in the resulting equations,\nand a similarity law therefore can be\nwritten expressing a correction to the newtonian\nnormal-force coefficient .  for the delta wing,\na correlation of experimental data according to the\nsimilarity law is shown, and the first terms\nof the solution are derived under the assumption\nthat the similarity parameter is small (\nvertex angle much smaller than mach angle) .": "similarity"}
